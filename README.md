<h2>📖 About The Project</h2>
Studying for certifications shouldn't mean drowning in boring PDFs and Excel spreadsheets. Scrum Master Prep is a modern study companion designed to visualize your progress, keep you motivated, and help you identify exactly which knowledge areas need improvement before test day.

<h2>✨ Key Features</h2>
1. 🎯 Motivation-First Dashboard
Don't just study blindly. The app features a clear, semi-circle mastery gauge that puts your goals front and center.

Visual Progress: Watch your "Mastery" score climb from 0 to 100% in real-time.

Clear Breakdown: Instantly see which questions are "Mastered," "Familiar," or "New/To Review."

Goal Oriented: Designed to give you the data-driven confidence to KO the exam on your first try.

2. 📚 250+ Questions Included (Free!)
Unlike other prep apps that hide content behind paywalls, this repository comes pre-loaded with a comprehensive dataset.

Full Question Bank: Includes 258+ relevant Scrum questions.

Ready to Run: No manual data entry required; the QUESTIONS database is pre-populated and ready to go.

This codebase is structured to be easily understood and modified by LLMs like Google AI Studio.

Clean Architecture: Types and data are separated, making it easy for AI agents to refactor code.
